Takes a shape and represents it using different sizes of squares

This program was written to divide shapes defined on a grid into a smaller number of larger squares rather than needing to store every tile the shape is made up of. I was also curious to see if it was possible to solve this problem without use of quadtrees.

The code was written spring 2017.
